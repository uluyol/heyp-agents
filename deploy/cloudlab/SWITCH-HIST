# WORK IN PROGRESS
#
# So far, this script seems to set up AF2 traffic as highest priority.
# I am seeing a >9:<1 Gbps bandwidth split at AF2 / 0
# and a 7:2.5 Gbps split at AF3(or 4) / 0.
#
# Since we only need two classes, uses AF3 and 0.
#
# TODO: how many ports are there?
#
# Notes:
# - Seems that the switches have Dell EMC Networking OS Release 9.13 installed.
