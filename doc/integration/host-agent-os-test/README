textprotos were converted to CSVs using
  mk-want-vs-have-csv -header -ignore_bad INPUT > OUTPUT

All results were collected on a Cloudlab xl170 machine.

rl-integration:
  sudo ./host-agent-os-test -run_dur 30s -max_rate_limit_mbps 500 -ignore_instantaneous_usage > rl-integration4.textproto
  (Clearly using the instantaneous usage data requires care, probably best to avoid)
